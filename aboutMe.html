            I graduated from McMaster University with an Honours Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, Summa Cum Laude.
            I took the following relevant courses:

            From these, my favorites were Discrete Math I and II, and Algorithms and Complexity since these were formal proof heavy courses, I enjoyed the challenge of this sort of work.

            Work History
        </h2>
        <p>
            During my schooling I had the opportunity to do Co-op internships at Intel and Questrade. Intel was my first
            software job and it was an amazing learning experience. I worked there from May 2020 to August 2021, and I had
            the opportunity to take on many different projects and even own some of the projects. I improved my C++ skills
            greatly, and had my first experience with modern C++ practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            My second internship was at Questrade, I worked there from May 2022 to August 2022. It was much shorter than my
            time in Intel, but I had the opportunity to do interesting work in a cloud environment, and was introduced to
            ideas of clusters. I also became much more knowledgable on financial instruments and how markets, brokers, and
            automated traders like Questrade worked. I learned lots about finance, networking, and Typescript.
