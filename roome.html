        RoomE was a robot built from the ground up which would out an area using lidar via exploration. I created the
        code for a majority of the systems including the pathfinding algorithm, the frontier exploration algorithm,
        interpreting the lidar data, and
        communicating via USB to the drive train system. The project was a great challenge and included many
        opportunities to solve algorithmic problems as well as the practical issues that come up with putting a large
        project together.<br> RoomE
        had 5 different software components:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Lidar Interface</li>
        <li>RoomE Map</li>
        <li>RoomE Navigation</li>
        <li>Drive Train Calculations</li>
        <li>Serial Communication</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        To give an overview of each, the lidar interface got data from the lidar and converted it into a form usable by
        the RoomE Map. The RoomE Map stored the overall map as a grid, held the orientation information of the RoomE,
        and could be updated by new scans
        in new locations using Continuous Iterative Closest Point (CICP) to correct for mistakes in the scans or the
        orientation updates. The RoomE Navigation component used the RoomE Map to find new areas to explore called
        frontiers, and provided a set
        of points that the RoomE would take to get to the new location. The Drive Train Calculations component was
        responsible for taking the points produced by the navigation and formatting them so that the drive train could
        understand them, and was
        also responsible for translating the odometry information from the drive train into orientation update
        information that could be used by the RoomE Map component. The Serial Communication component worked as a two
        way interface for communications
        between the drive train and the Drive Train calcualtions component. I was responsible for creating all of the
        software components except for the Drive Train Calculations component.
    </p>

    <p>
        The flow of the program was to scan, update the map, find a new navigation target, navigate to that area,
        calculate an approximate new location coordinate, and repeat until there were no more frontiers to explore. The
        final map would then be saved.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Lidar Interface is very simplistic, it only takes the output from the lidar module and
        converts it into a data type which can be interpreted by the RoomE Map. The only caveat is that the degree 0 was
        shifted by an integer that
        was discovered via experimentation. The lidar only gave an array of values denoting how far away each ray was,
        and the degree that the ray was shot from was denoted by the index in the array, I found that the degree 0 was
        not the 0'th element
        of the array, and found a shift was necessary to find the true zero degree.
    </p>
    <p>
        The RoomE Map used an occupancy grid map, where each of the points on the grids were either occupied,
        unoccupied or unknown, it was a fuzzy representation such that 0 was definitely occupied, 1 was definitely
        unoccupied, and then anything
        inbetween was an estimate at certainty, with 0.5 as completely unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
        The RoomE Navigation component takes the occupancy grid map, and uses breadth first search to walk through
        the grid through the unoccupied squares. It finds all of the frontiers which are locations which are borders of
        unoccupied and unknown
        areas. The entire set of unknown points which are neighbors with eachother and a known unoccupied point are
        considered a single frontier. For instance if RoomE made a scan in a hallway, it would see a frontier for each
        open door which it cannot
        see into.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Serial Communication component is very simple and sends and recieves commands in an agreed upon format
        with the Arduino running the drive train. The drive train can only understand time to move the right and left
        wheel so it depends on
        the Drive Train Calculations component to transform the navigation points into wheel rotations. The Arduino then
        sends back the number of rotations of each wheel which can be used to calculate the new position more accurately
        which can then be
        used by the map system to adjust for any error.
