                I am an undergraduate computer science student at McMaster University, I love programming, hacking, classic
                liturature, sports, and music. This website mainly focuses on the first two. I interned at Intel from May
                2020 to August 2021, and at Questrade from May 2022 to August 2022. In the meantime I created the projects
                listed below.

                    RoomE was a capstone project on my Computer Science degree. It was a robot built from the ground up which
                    would out an area using lidar via exploration. I created the code for a majority of the systems including
                    the pathfinding algorithm, the frontier exploration algorithm, interpreting the lidar data, and
                    communicating via USB to the drive train system. The project was a great challenge and included many
                    opportunities to solve algorithmic problems as well as the practical issues that come up with putting a
                    large project together.

                    Twitch Clipper was a scraping bot I made to create 10 minute videos of highlights from twitch streams.
                    I had the idea when I was watching a video of twitch clips put into a compilation and thought that it was such
                    a simple task that I could probably automate it. The end result was a bot that given a list of channels and a game will find 
                    recent popular clips for those channels and edit together a video of those clips.

                    Sorting Visualizer was one of my first personal projects. I made it in order to explore sorting algorithms in an interesting way.
                    I was inspired by videos on Youtube called "The sounds of sorting", wherin bars of various lengths were scrambled and sorted with different algorithms, 
                    and each comparison and swap would play a sound. My take on this was to create a program which would create videos of images being 
                    scrambled and then sorted with the sorting algorithm or algorithms of the user's choice.
